=============

**Jasper2fork project is back ! We're changing the project name to OVIA, for Open Vocal Intelligent Assistant !**

**Some links will may not work due to the name change, thanks to warn us**

This is the fork of the J2 fork of thejasperproject, thank you for all the work to this point.

Client code for the OVIA voice computing platform. OVIA is an **open source** platform for developing _always-on_, _voice-controlled_ applications.

Say hello to OVIA, an Open Virtual Intelligent Assistant. OVIA can do a lot for you. We are working on creating a real working Jarvis for everyone to use everyday. If you have seen any movies like Iron Man, then you will know what we're talking about. :grin:

This fork is a work in progress and as such if you find something missing/broke/anything please make a pull request with tests would be nice, or file an issue.

The current plan is to use [Discord](https://discord.gg/cVMrAbj) and Github for the day to day comms.

## Installation

You can find installations steps on [the new wiki](https://github.com/theOVIAproject/OVIA/wiki)

There you'll also find informations to setup OVIA and how to use it

## Data policy 

We don't want to depend on having your data used saved online in order to use OVIA.

We are going to let you decide how it works. You can use online AI services or use offline AI services (on your devices). OVIA can even use both. By using online services,your assistant has access to much more, but the service records everything you give them. Devices are getting stronger locally, let's use that to our advantageâ€¦ 

**OVIA is developed with :heart: and modern open source tech to benefit to all, that's why we won't collect and use your personnal data**
