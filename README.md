=============

**Jasper2fork project is back !**

This is the fork of the J2 fork of thejasperproject, thank you for all the work to this point.

Client code for the Jasper voice computing platform. Jasper is an **open source** platform for developing _always-on_, _voice-controlled_ applications.

Say hello to Jasper, an Open Virtual Intelligent Assistant. Jasper can do a lot for you. We are working on creating a real working Jarvis for everyone to use everyday. If you have seen any movies like Iron Man, then you will know what we're talking about. :grin:

This fork is a work in progress and as such if you find something missing/broke/anything please make a pull request with tests would be nice, or file an issue.

The current plan is to use [Discord](https://discord.gg/kSnVC9C) and Github for the day to day comms.

## Installation

You can find installations steps on [the new wiki](https://github.com/jasper2fork/j2f/wiki)

There you'll also find informations to setup Jasper and how to use it

## Data policy 

We don't want to depend on having your data used saved online in order to use Jasper.

We are going to let you decide how Jasper works. You can use online AI services or use offline AI services (on your devices). Jasper can even use both. By using online services, Jasper has access to much more, but the service records everything you give them. Devices are getting stronger locally, let's use that to our advantageâ€¦ 

**Jasper is developed with :heart: and modern open source tech to benefit to all, that's why we won't collect and use your personnal data**
